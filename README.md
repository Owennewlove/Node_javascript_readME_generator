# Node_javascript_readME_generator

## Description

The goal was to make a readMe generator with node. Javascript and node were used to make this happen. If node index.js is typed into the terminal than the terminal will prompt questions to create a professional readMe file. Once all of the questions have been answered the readMe will be generated into the ouput folder.
